udns (0.0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * s/EOVERFLOW/ENFILE, partly to make win32 happy

  * several win32 fixes

  * don't use `class' in udns.h, to make C++ happy
    (thanks Markus Koetter for pointing this out)

  * fixed CNAME handling in dnsget tool.  Another Thank You! goes
    to Markus Koetter.

  * NAPTR (RFC3403) support, thanks to Mikael Magnusson
    <mikma at users.sourceforge.net> for this.

  * more Win32 fixes from Mikael Magnusson.  I have to admit
    I never tried to compile it on Win32.

  * added NOTES file

  * reworked initialisation stuff.  Minor API changes -- new dns_reset(),
    dns_init() now has one more argument, corrections to dns_close(),
    dns_open(), dns_free().  Cleaned up *_internal() routines.

  * moved dns_init() routine into separate file.

  * reworked dn suffix searching.  As a result, query only has
    dnsq_dn[] field -- no header and EDNS0 "suffix", and query
    packet is now formatted in dns_send()

  * added inet_XtoX.c - public domain implementations of inet_pton()
    and inet_ntop(), inet_aton() and inet_ntoa() routines.

  * added getopt.c - public domain implementation of getopt() routine.

  * switched to autoconf-style configuration

  * introduce dns_random16() to generate query IDs
    (currently based on gettimeofday.tv_usec)

  * dnsget: fix printing of -t ANY and -c any records,
    thanks to Jaroslaw Rafa

  * implement dns_ntop() and dns_pton() as either wrappers or
    reimplementations (using inet_XtoX.c) of inet_ntop() and inet_pton().
    Too much troubles with portability - it was a complete mess, each
    OS has its own problems with them.
    And use those routines everywhere.

  * s/WIN32/WINDOWS/g to allow building on WIN64.  Oh well.

  * try to find query by ID first, don't drop header-only replies early.
    This is in order to support FORMERR replies from nameservers which
    don't understand EDNS0.

  * retry queries w/o EDNS0 if sent with it and if
    server reported FORMERR or NOTIMPL

  * fixed debian/copyright and debian/control

  * rblcheck revamp

udns (0.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * don't compare sockaddr_in's, but individual parts only
    (on some OSes, there are additional fields in this structure
    so memcmp() does not quite work)

  * use dnsc_t instead of unsigned char for DNs everywhere

  * SRV records (rfc2782) parsing, thanks to
    Thadeu Lima de Souza Cascardo.

  * manpage fixes

udns (0.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * added dnsget.1 and rblcheck.1 manpages.

  * internal: use generic list implementation in udns_resolver.c

  * don't assume only backward DN pointers in replies, allow forward
    pointers too.  This is quite large change, involves changing
    parsing API all over the places.

  * internal: typedef dnsc_t and dnscc_t for [const] unsigned char, to
    make function prototypes shorter to better fit on a single line.

  * in parsing routines, verify (assert) that the query type
    is the one we can handle.

  * recognize names (and resolve them) as nameservers in dnsget.

  * when new request is submitted, don't send it immediately, but
    add it into the head of the active queue with deadline=0.
    This will allow us to tweak some query settings before it will
    be processed.
    Note API change: removed `now' argument from all dns_submit_*()
    routines.

  * use single per-context user timer, not per-query.
    Note API change: different user timer callback

  * add dnsc_salen field -- length of the socket address used

  * fix dns_set_opt(DNS_OPT_FLAGS) which didn't work before

  * allow to set some options for a context wich is open but with no
    active queries
